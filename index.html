    <p>
            <img src="./assets/images/marina-avatar.jpg" id="avatar"> My name is Marina and I'm a proud owner of a dog named Joey and a cat named Stevie. Original from Tel Aviv, I have been living in Belin for the past 3 years with my husband. A year and a half ago our daughter Lyri joined us.         
      My favorite things in life are my family, friends, coffee and reading. I usually read 3-4 books at the same time, I use books as escapism so my favorite genres are YA (Yong Adults) books and fantasy.<br> 
      <br>
      For the past decade, I have been working in the field of Digital Marketing in different roles; as SEO,Specialist, Campaigns Manager Project Manager and Retention Manager. And now I'm excited to start my journey into becoming web developer.
